# Project_4_Financial_Stock

# BACKGROUND

In this project, we will be collecting a dataset from the yahoo finance which is a financial stock data, and using a python script which has been initialised, trained and used to evaluate our model. 

# INSTRUCTIONS

This project has been broken down into four parts

- Part 1: DATA EXTRACTION
We have extracted our Data from yahoo finance and can be accessed through this link -

 Our Data was loaded using a python script and sklearn, we have been able to initialise the dataset using the LSTM model as this was the best choice for a financial stock data.

- Part 3 : DATA MODEL OPTIMIZATION 
The Model optimisation and evaluation process shows iterative changes on our model selected which has also resulted in changes in performance These changes have been saved in a csv file and can be accessed in the output folder.

- Part 4 : PREDICTIONS AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE 
Model predictions and overall performance has been printed out and displayed at the end of our python script and also saved as a csv file.

- Part 5 : TABLEAU VISUALIZATION 
We have been able to also create a visualizations of our data, predicted prices and also overall performance of various company stocks selected and here is a link to our tableau visualization.
